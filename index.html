    <p>[Verse]<br>
        Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars<br>
        I'm going to give you my heart<br>
        Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars<br>
        And cause you light up the path<br>
       <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        I don't care, go on and tear me apart<br>
        I don't care if you do<br>
        Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars<Br>
        I think I saw you-oou-ooou-ou<Br>
        <br>
        [interlude]<br>
        ......<br>
        <br>
        [Verse]<Br>
        Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars<br>
        I want to die in your arms, arms<br>
        Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark<br>
        I'm going to give you my heart<br>
        <Br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        I don't care, go on and tear me apart<br>
        I don't care if you do<br>
        Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars<br>
        I think I see you-oou-ooou-ou<br>
        I think I see you-oou-ooou-ou<br>
        <br>
        [Interlude]<br>
        .....<br>
       <br>
        [Outro]<br>
        Because you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars<br>
        Such a Heavenly view<br>
        Such a Heavenly view</p>
